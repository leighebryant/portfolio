    <p><h1>About</h1> I discovered my love for design and a curiosity for code at a young age, and after attending East Carolina University to receive my Bachelor of Fine Arts, I chose to attend the Front-End Engineering program at The Iron Yard to delve further into the world of front-end development.
      <br><br>
    In my free time when Iâ€™m not designing or developing, I enjoy competitively riding horses, reading, and trying out whatever new recipe I stumble across online.
